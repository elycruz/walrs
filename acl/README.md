# walrs_acl 

Basic Access Control List (ACL) structure for adding role/permissions based access control to applications.

## How does it work?

The ACL control is designed to manage relationships between resources, roles, privileges and rules and their interrelationships to each of their set (roles inheriting from other roles etc.).

## Usage

@todo

Instantiate your `Acl` struct - add `Role`s, `Resource`s, and allow/deny rules to it
Next tie the interface into your application's frontend/action controller/dispatcher, check permissions and rules and allow/deny access to resources as needed.

```rust
// @todo
```

  - [ ] Acl related:
    - [ ] Ensure all public API methods, with a complexity higher than 1-2, have doc tests. (`is_allowed`, `is_allowed_any` etc.).   
    - [ ] Internal symbol (role, resource, or privilege) storage should be on the heap - We don't know how long passed in symbols will live so need to own the ones that are added/tracked.
  - [x] `AclData` - Provides a data parseable struct, when loading data from files, for `Acl` struct. 
  - [x] `impl From<... File> for AclData`
    - [ ] Write companion tests against json representation, of an Acl. 
  - [x] `impl From<... AclData> for Acl`
    - [ ] Write companion tests against json representation, of an Acl. 
  - [ ] Control should function be thread safe - Add test showing this case.
  - [ ] Language in acl, and API, should be changed to match 'privilege' instead of 'access to privilege' since, we're effectively saying the same thing (lol).
  - [ ] Cleanup API - Remove un-required methods etc., in rule structs, etc..

### About Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACL's can be defined either in a domain model, or as one, or more, text files.

ACLs are made up of the following entities:

- Resources - Named internet resources (internal, or otherwise).
- Roles - Roles a user may take in an application.
- Group - Group of Roles.
- Role and Groups - List of groups of roles.
- Privileges - A subset, action, and/or a subset entrypoint to a resource.
- Access Control Lists (ACLs).

Additionally, ACLs can be made up of the following data structures:

1.  A roles/role-groups graph - Allows nodes to inherit from each other.
2.  A resources graph - "".
3.  An ACL.

#### Storage Mechanisms

ACLs can be stored in any storage format that is accessible by a target application:

- Relational DB.
- Text files (*.txt, *.yaml, etc.).
- etc.

##### Text Representation

Common text based formats, that can easily be used to create an ACL representation, include (but are not limited to):

- *.txt
- *.json
- *.yaml
- etc.

###### Plain Text Example:

Here we'll demonstrate storing role, resource, and role-group, graphs alongside the ACL structure, in a plain text file.

**General Structure:**

```text
# Role Graph

{role} {[..., {role}]} 

# Role Group Graph

{role-group} {[..., {role-group}]} 

# Resource Graph

{resource} {[..., {resource}]}

# ACL

{resource}
  {[deny, allow]}
    {privilege}
      {user-group}
```

**Example:**

```text
# Roles
# ----
guest
user guest
admin user

# Resources
# ----
index
blog index
products blog

# Groups
# ----
app-guest guest
app-user app-guest
app-admin app-user
cms-guest app-guest
cms-user cms-guest
cms-admin cms-user

# ACL
# ----
all
  deny
    all
index all
  allow
    index
      guest
blog index
  allow
    create
      cms-user
    read 
      guest
    update
      cms-user
    delete
      cms-admin
    disable
      cms-user
products blog
```

###### JSON Example

**example-acl.json** (WIP)

```json
{
  "roles": [
    ["guest", null],
    ["user", ["guest"]],
    ["admin", ["user"]]
  ],
  "resources": [
    ["index", null],
    ["blog", ["index"]],
    ["account", null],
    ["users", null]
  ],
  "rules": {
    "allow": [
      ["index", [["guest", null]]],
      ["account", [["user", ["index", "update", "read"]]]],
      ["users", [["admin", null]]]
    ],
    "deny": null
  }
}
```

Here roles inherit from other roles, and resources, from other resources.

Where ever you see `null` those we represent as `Option<...>`, in data struct.

For `rules.allow` resources allow access to roles on privileges, if `null` means all privileges ('read', 'update', etc.).

## Brainstorm

Distill rules structure:

```rust

enum RuleType {
  Allow = 0,
  Deny = 1,
}

type PrivilegeRule = RuleType;

struct PrivilegeRules<'a> {
  fpr_all_privileges: PrivilegeRule,
  by_privilege_id: Option<HashMap<&'a str, PrivilegeRule>>,
}

struct RoleRules<'a> {
  for_all_roles: PrivilegeRules<'a>,
  by_role_id: Option<HashMap<&'a str, PrivilegeRules<'a>>>,
}

struct ResourceRules<'a> {
  for_all_resources: RoleRules<'a>,
  by_resource_id: HashMap<&'a str, RoleRules<'a>>,
}
```
