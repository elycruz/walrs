# wal-rs (work-in-progress)

An experimental Web Application Library, for Rust - The project is in research and development so please do not use for production code.

## (currently) in development:

- `wal_inputfilter` - A set of `Input` validation structs used to validate primitive values as they pertain to web applications.
- `wal_acl` - An access control list structure.
- `wal_graph` - A collection of basic graph structures to use in `wal_acl` and `wal_navigation`, etc.
- `wal_navigation` - A collection of structs to use to compose web page link graphs.  Can also be integrated with `wal_acl`.  This structure is overall useful in scenarios where page access needs to be controlled from the application level.
