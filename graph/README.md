# walrs_graph crate

Custom graph, and digraph, crate containing graph structures used in the content management system (also, controls used by `walrs_acl`, and `walrs_navigation`).

## Inspiration

Direct rips from the following (with rust idiom modifications):

- Algorithms 4th Ed. - Chapters on 'graphs' - https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/40graphs/

## Implementations

- [x] `Digraph`
- [x] `DisymGraph` - Directed Symbol Graph.
- [ ] @todo List remainder of `digraph::*` structures here.
- [ ] `Graph`
- [ ] `SymbolGraph` - Should be renamed to `SymGraph`.
- [ ] @todo List remainder of `graph::*` structures here.
